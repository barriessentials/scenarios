                    14 year old Marcus has been acting out in class lately and his teacher wants to determine if he
                    needs any supportive services. The teacher refers Marcus to a mental health therapist with whom the
                    school contracts.

                    the middle school counselor who tells him that the contracted mental health therapist conducted an
                    assessment and made referrals; the principal then calls the therapist to ask for the results of the

                    <span class="correct">Most likely</span>. There is a FERPA exception to obtaining parental consent

                    principal. But we do not have enough information to know. First, FERPA allows school officials to
                    disclose information in the education record to other "school officials/teachers" within the school
                    who have a "legitimate educational interest" in that information. If the school has a policy of
                    allowing such release, the school must include, in its annual written notification to parents, the
                    specific criteria for determining who is a school official and what constitutes a legitimate
                    educational interest. Employees of organizations with whom the school contracts to provide services
                    may be considered "school officials." A school official has a "legitimate educational interest" in
                    the information when he or she needs the information to do his/her job. But any disclosure made
                    under this exception must satisfy the criteria included in the school's annual written notification
                    to parents. Also, individuals who receive information under this exception must be made aware that
                    they cannot re-release the information except in accordance with FERPA. BUT NOTE: any notes made by a
                    school professional, such as a mental health therapist, that the professional does not share with
                    others may not be released with the educational record, even to the parent.
