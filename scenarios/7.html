                    You presume that the IL worker wants the information to support Charmaine in her educational goals,
                    but you don't know that for a fact.

                <p>
                    You decide to research before you answer the IL worker's questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through your research, you find that

                    applies to the information because it governs
                    the disclosure of educational records by a school counselor.

                    You wonder if the Uninterrupted Scholars Act amendment to FERPA applies to the IL caseworker in this
                    case.

                <p>
                    You write down some notes on FERPA:
                </p>

                <blockquote class="handwritten">
                    FERPA as amended by USA allows "an agency caseworker or other representative of a State or local
                    child welfare agency&hellip;who has the right to access a student's case plan" and is "legally
                    responsible for the care and protection of a child" to obtain the child's education records.

                    You think that based on the plain language of the amendment, a private provider may count an "other
                    representative" of a child welfare agency, so you search to see if the guidance explains further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, you realize that the guidance doesn't explain if the private provider (or contractor) can count
                    as an agency representative for <i>disclosure</i> purposes. The only guidance provided covers
                    redisclosure for private providers.

                        Child welfare agencies can only <i>redisclose</i> education records obtained through this exception
                        to "an

                        One example of an appropriate redisclosure would be to a contractor providing services to
