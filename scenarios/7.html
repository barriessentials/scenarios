                    Seventeen year-old Charmaine is in 11th grade and is living in an Independent Living (IL)
                    arrangement where she was placed by the dependency court. The IL provider case worker contacts you,
                    Charmaine's high school guidance counselor, with some questions about Charmaine's educational
                    progress.

                    Specifically, the IL worker asks you, the guidance counselor, the following information about
                    Charmaine:
                </p>

                <ul class="reveal-list">
                    <li>why she was not promoted to 12th grade at the start of the school year;</li>
                    <li>how many credits and what courses she needs to graduate;</li>
                    <li>her new anticipated graduation date;</li>
                    <li>her current course load; and</li>
                    <li>her grades thus far in this school year.</li>

                    You presume that the IL worker wants the information to support Charmaine in her educational goals,
                    but you don't know that for a fact. You decide to research before you answer the IL worker's
                    questions. Through your research, you find that

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>
                        <option value="correct">FERPA</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">HIPAA</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">CFR Part 2</option>
                    </select>

                    applies to the information because it governs
                    the disclosure of educational records by a school counselor.

                    You wonder if the Uninterrupted Scholars Act amendment to FERPA applies to the IL caseworker in this
                    case. You write down some notes on FERPA:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    FERPA as amended by USA allows "an agency caseworker or other representative of a State or local
                    child welfare agency&hellip;who has the right to access a student's case plan" and is "legally
                    responsible for the care and protection of a child" to obtain the child's education records.

                <p>
                    You think that based on the plain language of the amendment, a private provider may count an "other
                    representative" of a child welfare agency, so you search to see if the guidance explains further.
                    But, you realize that the guidance doesn't explain if the private provider (or contractor) can count
                    as an agency representative for <i>disclosure</i> purposes. The only guidance provided covers
                    redisclosure for private providers. You write down some notes based on what you read in new U.S.
                    Department of Education the Family Privacy Compliance Office
                    <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/uninterrupted-scholars-act-guidance.pdf" target="_blank">guidance from May 2014</a>,
                    and highlight some relevant parts:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    Child welfare agencies can only <i>redisclose</i> education records obtained through this exception to "an
                    individual or entity engaged in addressing the student's education needs" who is authorized by the
                    child welfare agency to receive the records, and consistent with other state confidentiality laws.
                    One example of an appropriate redisclosure would be to a contractor providing services to address a
                    student's education needs.

                    You decide to err on the side of caution to see what other exceptions of FERPA apply to these
                    records. What else could you do to release the requested information to the IL worker? Check all
                    could that apply:
