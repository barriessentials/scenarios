                    a delinquency adjudication. At his last hearing, the RTF told the judge that Bill will be discharged
                    in a month.

                    Bill's child welfare case worker convenes a multi-agency team meeting to develop a
                    re-entry/transition plan for Bill for his return to the community. In attendance at the meeting
                    <em>(photos of the participants will appear here)</em> : the child welfare case worker; a representative of the RTF; a teacher
                    and school counselor from the local high school that Bill was attending before his placement; an
                    outpatient mental health counselor who treated Bill previously; and a juvenile probation officer.
                    The caseworker wants to collect information about Bill's progress in the RTF, including mental
                    health treatment and educational progress; his ongoing treatment needs; and what treatment and
                    education options are available to him once he returns to the community.
