                    Ten year-old Linus recently entered the child welfare system. The local children & youth agency
                    places Linus with a foster family. The children & youth case worker learned during his investigation
                    that Linus has an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The case worker and Linus's foster mother
                    each contact the special education teacher at Linus's school to obtain a copy of Linus's IEP and
                    tell the teacher that they want to be included in all future meetings at the school regarding Linus.

                    The case worker and the foster mother both attend an IEP meeting for Linus. At the end of the
                    meeting, the special education teacher asks <em>both</em> the case worker and foster mother to sign the IEP
                    on the line "parent/guardian". You are the caseworker, and you have a feeling that you can't sign
                    the IEP. You try to think of the law that applies so you can formulate an answer for the teacher.
                    You tell the teacher that the following law/s apply:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a class="open-modal" href="#s3-a">A. FERPA</a></li>
                    <li><a class="open-modal" href="#s3-b">B. Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act
                        (IDEIA)</a></li>
                    <li><a class="open-modal correct" href="#s3-c">C. FERPA <em>and</em> the Individuals with Disabilities
                        Education Improvement Act (IDEIA)</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <a href="#4.0" class="button hide">NEXT</a>

            <div id="s3-a" class="modal">
                <p><span class="correct">Partially correct</span>, FERPA applies because the foster parent
                    and the case worker want Linus' school records. But, remember that the particular record they want
                    is a special education record for which IDEIA applies. Therefore, IDEIA applies too.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="s3-b" class="modal">
                <p><span class="correct">Partially correct</span>, the IDEIA applies, but so does FERPA. The
                    IDEIA applies because we are talking about an IEP and although the IDEIA confidentiality regulations
                    incorporate FERPA, they also contain some provisions that apply to only special education records.
                    FERPA applies because the IEP may include some other elements that are in the education record more
                    generally.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="s3-c" class="modal">
                <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>, both FERPA and the IDEIA apply because we are talking
                    about an IEP and the education record more generally.</p>

                    You then explain to the teacher that under the IDEIA you, the caseworker,

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>

                        <option value="correct">cannot</option>
                    </select>

                    sign the IEP. You explain to the teacher that under IDEIA a "parent" &mdash; the education decision
                    maker in the special education system &mdash; can be a biological or adoptive parent, a foster
                    parent (<i>if permitted under state law</i>), a guardian generally or specially authorized to make
                    education decisions for the child, someone with whom the child lives who acts as the parent, someone
                    who is legally responsible for the child's welfare, or a surrogate parent. But a caseworker can
                    never be a "parent."

                    Therefore in this scenario, if the foster mother is permitted under state law to act as the
                    education decision-maker, and the birth or adoptive parent is not attempting to act as the education
                    decision-maker, the foster mother can act as the education decision maker. In that case, the school

                    educational decision-maker can also sign the IEP.

                <p>
                    Note: If state law does NOT permit a foster parent to act as an IDEIA "parent," the juvenile court
                    can appoint the foster parent as a "surrogate parent" for a child who is in the custody of a child
                    welfare agency.

                    Then the teacher asks you if under FERPA she can share the IEP with you (the caseworker) and the
                    foster mother. Fill in the blanks below with your advice.

                    Under a recent FERPA amendment, the Uninterrupted Scholars Act (USA), the children and youth
                    caseworker

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>
                        <option value="correct">has</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">does not have</option>
                    </select>

                    access to Linus' education record and IEP. Under the USA, the children and youth caseworker, who has
                    the right to access a child's case plan under state law and whose agency has legal responsibility
                    for the care of the youth,

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>
                        <option value="correct">can</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">cannot</option>
                    </select>

                    access the child's educational records. The child welfare caseworker may then disclose the records
                    to individuals/entities engaged in addressing the youth's education needs as long as the

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">parent</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">child</option>
                        <option value="correct">child welfare agency</option>
                    </select>

                    authorizes those individuals/entities to receive such records. Thus, the educational information
                    could possibly be shared with the foster mother for purposes of addressing the youth's education
                    needs without consent of the parent if the child welfare agency authorizes it.

                    Great job! Keep reading to help the teacher understand more about releasing school records.

                    The teacher then asks you if there's any way to disclose the information directly to the foster
                    mother without going through the child welfare agency. You answer the following:

                    The court in the child welfare agency may issue a/an

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>

                        <option value="correct">order</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">injunction</option>
                    </select>

                    authorizing the school to release records to the foster mother. FERPA allows schools to release
                    records in response to a court order. Normally, FERPA

                    <select class="fill-in-the-blank">
                        <option value="">Select</option>
                        <option value="correct">requires</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">does not require</option>
                    </select>

                    the school to notify the parent before disclosing records pursuant to a court order. However, USA
                    amended FERPA to specifically provide that if such an order is issued in a child welfare case to
                    which the child's parent is a party, the school is not required to provide additional notice to the
                    parent prior to releasing the records.
