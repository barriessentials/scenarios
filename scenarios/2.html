                    Fifteen year-old James was taken into custody by a School Resource Officer (SRO) for failing to
                    follow school rules or policies and being "ungovernable," defined in the state's children's code as
                    a violation of law.

                    James gets a court date to contest his governability, before which the prosecuting attorney's office
                    and the probation office both contact the school.

                    The prosecuting attorney's office and the probation office want James's school attendance record,

                    offered James in the past.
