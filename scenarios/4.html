                    Sally runs the Student Assistance Program (SAP) at a local area high school.  She receives a phone
                    call from a case worker at the local children & youth agency who informs her that one of her
                    students, 15-year-old Jake, is on her caseload.  The caseworker states that Jake informed her that
                    he was receiving substance abuse treatment and counseling through the SAP.  The caseworker wants to
                    get information about Jake's participation in the SAP – what kinds of treatment he's receiving and
                    how he's doing – to present at Jake's next court hearing.

                    progress in the SAP – specifically, what kinds of treatment he's receiving and how he's doing.

            <div id="s6-b" class="modal">
                <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>, here Part 2 applies rather than HIPAA. Part 2
                    protects all information about any person who has applied for or been given diagnosis or treatment
                    for alcohol or drug abuse at a federally assisted program. See 42 CFR §2.11 (definition of a
                    "patient"). Although there are times when HIPAA and Part 2 apply to a record, this is not one of
                    those times.</p>

            <div id="s6-c" class="modal">
                <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>, the Federal Drug & Alcohol (D&A) regulations at 42 CFR Part 2
                    apply to Jake's SAP records. In the substance abuse treatment field, confidentiality is governed by
                    the federal drug and alcohol (FDAC) laws (42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2) and regulations (42 CFR Part 2).
                    These FDAC laws and regulations outline the limited circumstances when information about an
                    individual's drug or alcohol treatment may be disclosed without the individual's consent. Here,
                    Jake's records are clearly in the substance abuse field because that is what the SAP program does
                    and what his caseworker wants information about.</p>

            <div id="s6-d" class="modal">
                <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>, the IDEA requires states to provide school-age children
                    with "free, appropriate public education" in the "least restrictive environment." Part B of the act
                    sets forth the process for providing such education, including evaluations for services, eligibility
                    determinations, individualized education programs (IEPs), educational placements, and procedural
                    safeguards. Part B also contains provisions regarding the confidentiality of these special education
                    records. Jake's substance abuse records have nothing to do with any potential special education
                    needs.</p>

                    2 it is important to look at whether state law permits the child to consent to treatment. The age of

                    Note that alternatively, the SAP may disclose information upon receiving a court order accompanied
                    by a subpoena. However, the court can issue the order only on a showing of good cause, weighing the
                    public interest against the potential injury to the youth.
