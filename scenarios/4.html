            <div id="s4-b" class="modal modal-wide">
                <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>. In this case, Part 2 applies rather than HIPAA. Part 2
                    protects all information about any person who has applied for or been given diagnosis or treatment
                    for alcohol or drug abuse at a federally assisted program. See 42 CFR &sect;2.11 (definition of a
                    "patient"). Although there are times when HIPAA and Part 2 apply to a record, this is not one of
                    those times.</p>

            <div id="s4-c" class="modal modal-wide">
                <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>. The Federal Drug & Alcohol (D&A) regulations at 42 CFR Part 2
                    apply to Jake's SAP records. In the substance abuse treatment field, confidentiality is governed by
                    the federal drug and alcohol (FDAC) laws (42 U.S.C. &sect;290dd-2) and regulations (42 CFR Part 2).
                    These FDAC laws and regulations outline the limited circumstances when information about an
                    individual's drug or alcohol treatment may be disclosed without the individual's consent. Here,
                    Jake's records are clearly in the substance abuse field because that is what the SAP program does
                    and what his caseworker wants information about.</p>

            <div id="s4-d" class="modal modal-wide">
                <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>. The IDEA requires states to provide school-age children
                    with "free, appropriate public education" in the "least restrictive environment." Part B of the act
                    sets forth the process for providing such education, including evaluations for services, eligibility
                    determinations, individualized education programs (IEPs), educational placements, and procedural
                    safeguards. Part B also contains provisions regarding the confidentiality of these special education
                    records. Jake's substance abuse records have nothing to do with any potential special education
                    needs.</p>
