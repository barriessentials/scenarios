                    You are the district attorney, and you want information from the child welfare agency about Denise
                    and her family to help you decide whether to file a petition against the youth, and also how to
                    proceed if the case is filed (for example, whether to consent to an Adjournment Contemplating
                    Dismissal).

                    <li>What is the history of the family involvement with the agency?</li>
                    <li>Has the parent abused the youth in the past?</li>
