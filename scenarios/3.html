                    Sixteen-year-old Katy is before Judge Hicks on charges of aggravated assault.  Katy has been in court a number of
                    times on various charges, this being the most serious.  Katy has pled guilty to the current charge and has been

                                "HIPAA governs our hospital's ability to release health care records. I can try to obtain a
                                signed authorization from the patient or her parent.  Without the authorization, I can release
                                them to the agency if you have a court order authorizing the release, or if the agency's health
                                unit is considered a health care provider who is providing care to Katy."

                    This is not an accurate response. There are several ways in which the records can be properly released.

                <p>
                    This is not a wholly accurate response. Although a signed authorization is the preferred method for
                    authorizing the release of health information, there are exceptions under HIPAA which could apply in this situation.

            <div id="hospital-response-3-modal" class="modal">
                <p>
                    This is an accurate response, as HIPAA provides an exception for the release of health care information to
                    treatment providers providing care to a patient. However, it is not a complete response.

                <p>
                    <span class="correct">This is the best response</span>. It notes the possible exceptions and the ultimate
                    requirement of obtaining a signed authorization if no exception can apply. In this situation, it is likely
                    the court would order release of the information if an authorization was not able to be obtained.  Many
                    attorneys who represent children in dependency and delinquency proceedings routinely request that the courts
                    include in their "orders of appointment" specific language authorizing health care providers to release their
                    client's records to them.  Thus, if the attorney in this case had such an order, that would be sufficient to
                    authorize the hospital to release the x-ray results to him.
