                    The child welfare caseworker knows that FERPA generally allows a school to disclose education records with parental
                    consent and only if the recipient agrees not to re-disclose the records without first obtaining additional parental
                    consent.

                <p>
                    The caseworker must first determine whether any or all of the requested information meets the definition
                    of education records. She believes that disciplinary actions are NOT considered part of the education record.
                    Is she correct?
