                Seventeen year-old Tommy became involved in the child welfare system two years ago as a result of chronic truancy.
                His child welfare agency caseworker regularly requests and receives reports from Tommy’s schools that include his
                attendance, grades, and any disciplinary actions.

            <p>Recently, Tommy was adjudicated delinquent and assigned a probation officer.</p>

                The probation officer contacts Tommy’s child welfare agency caseworker and asks her to provide him with the reports
                she receives from Tommy’s school so the probation officer can track Tommy’s progress to ensure he is complying with
                conditions of probation.  The child welfare agency caseworker is unclear as to whether she can re-disclose this
                information to the probation officer.

            <p>
                The child welfare caseworker knows that FERPA generally allows a school to disclose education records with parental
                consent and only if the recipient agrees not to re-disclose the records without first obtaining additional parental
                consent.  The caseworker must first determine whether any or all of the requested information meets the definition
                of education records.  She believes that disciplinary actions are NOT considered part of the education record.
                Is she correct?
            </p>

                    Correct. FERPA defines a student’s education record as records, files, documents, and other material maintained
                    by a school or a person acting for the school and containing information directly related to a student.
                    Reports from a school that include information about disciplinary actions are considered education records.
                    It is only if the disciplinary action is solely contained in a record made by officials of a school law
                    enforcement unit for a law enforcement purpose and kept separate from other records at the school that it
                    would not be considered part of the education record.

            <p>
                However, the caseworker believes that because she obtained the education records through application of the Uninterrupted
                Scholars Act (USA), she is automatically allowed to share the education records with probation without parental consent.
                Is she correct?

                    Incorrect. If the school discloses the records pursuant to the USA exception, FERPA says the caseworker may only
                    re-disclose the records to another individual or agency engaged in addressing the child’s education needs if the
                    child welfare agency authorizes such re-disclosure.  In this scenario, we have no information that the probation
                    officer is engaged in addressing the child’s education needs, nor that the child welfare agency authorizes the
                    caseworker to re-disclose the records to the probation officer.  So FERPA dictates that the caseworker would not
                    automatically be allowed to share the education records with probation if the caseworker received the information
                    via the USA.

                If the school had disclosed the records to the caseworker pursuant to a court order in the child’s dependency case,
                would the FERPA prohibition on re-disclosure apply?

                    consult the state laws/regulations governing the disclosure of child welfare case records to determine if he/she can
                    give the education records to Tommy’s probation officer without first getting a court order or a signed parental consent.
