                    The counselor is aware that the school has met the requirements for releasing directory information
                    without obtaining parental consent. This means the school has:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            notified parents about the specific types of directory information it may disclose,

                        <li>
                            parents have the opportunity to notify the school in writing that they do not want
                            information about their child disclosed.
                        </li>

                    The counselor shares the directory information with the SRO, but informs him that she cannot share
                    the student's attendance and disciplinary records and grades without parental authorization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, there is an exception to the parental authorization requirement that may apply in this
                    situation. FERPA allows disclosure without parental consent to:

            </div>

            <div id="s6-partial" class="modal modal-wide">
                <p>
                    <span class="correct">Partially correct</span>. The correct answer is <em>D</em> (Both <em>B</em> and

                        <span class="correct">Correct</span>!

                    <p>
                        Answer <em>B</em> is correct because FERPA allows disclosure without parental consent to other school
                        officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records. The school must include in an
                        annual notification to parents the specific criteria for determining who is a <i>school official</i>
                        and
                        what constitutes <i>a legitimate educational interest</i>. Additionally, if the SRO (and any other
                        individuals) in this case example were to receive information under this exception, they would have
                        to be informed that they cannot re-release the information except in accordance with FERPA.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Answer <em>C</em> is correct because FERPA also allows disclosure without parental consent if required to
                        comply with a court order or subpoena. If the school receives such an order or subpoena, it must
                        make a "reasonable effort" to notify the parents about the court order/subpoena before releasing the
                        records to law enforcement.
