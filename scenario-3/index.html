                    The counselor will need to consult state law to determine whether it is the parent or the student who must sign the
                    authorization. If state law allows the student to consent to receive mental health services from the counselor, it
                    is the student who must sign the release.  If state law requires parental consent before the student can receive
                    the counseling, then the parent must sign the authorization to release information.
