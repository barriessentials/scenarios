                    The state child welfare agency wants to include in its statewide database information about the

                    The child welfare agency knows which children are
                    in out-of-home placements, but needs local education agencies to supply information about their
                    enrollment and attendance, disciplinary histories (suspensions), grades, testing scores (e.g. in
                    math and reading), special education status, English as second language status, and graduation
                    rates.

                        FERPA allows state/local education agencies to release a child's education records to a state or
                        local child welfare agency or tribal organization when the agency or tribal organization is
                        "legally responsible for the child's care and protection."

                        disclosed to an agency representative who has the right to access the child's case plan. Thus,
                        under the USA the state and/or local education agency may disclose the requested information
                        about an individual child who is the legal responsibility of the child welfare agency to the
                        state child welfare agency.

                    <p>
                        The USA does not specifically address including such information in a child welfare agency
                        database. Instead it contemplates that the disclosure would be made to an agency representative
                        who is legally able to access the child’s case plan. However, if the child welfare agency
                        database is structured such that only persons who have a right to access a child's case plan can
                        access the child's education records, the disclosure is permissible under the USA.

                    Usually, under FERPA, before releasing records in response to a court order, the school must make a
                    "reasonable effort" to notify the parent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, under the USA amendment to FERPA, schools do not
                    need
                    to provide notice to parents prior to the release of records pursuant to the court order exception
                    when
                    the parents are parties to the child welfare case and, therefore, already are on notice that the
                    school
                    records will be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In such cases, school can release education records without parental
                    notification to any party listed on a child welfare case court order, such as the child welfare
                    agency
                    or caseworker, caretaker, children’s attorney, or court appointed special advocate.
